# Steps to reproduce simulations and networks "Graphical Models for Zero-Inflated Single Cell Gene Expression"

For simulations:
1. Run simulations.R
2. Run processSimulations.Rmd

For networks generated from Shalek et al data:

1. Run fitAlex.R
2. Run processShalekMAITNetworks.Rmd

For networks generated from TFh data, the source data is as-yet unpublished a primary journal so cannot yet be made available publically.
