\title{Interpolate a solution path using approxFun and reduce the coefficients in a block to their signed L2 norm}
\usage{
interpolateSummarizeCoefs(sol, blk, approxFun)
}
\arguments{
\item{sol}{solution (a list containing a sparse neighborhood matrix and the lambda over which it was evaluated)}

\item{blk}{a data table mapping between columns of sol$path and nodes}

\item{approxFun}{a function interpolating or otherwise approximating the solution between nodes}
}
\value{
data.table with columns `y` giving normed, interpolated values, `x` giving lamba values and `block` giving the node in question
}
