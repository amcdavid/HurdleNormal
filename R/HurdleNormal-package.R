##'  A Hurdle model is a modification of a distribution at zero. This
##'    package provides routines to estimate and sample from multivariate Hurdle models
##'    on a Normal density. These are distributions that are conditionally Normal, but with singularities along the coordinate axes, so generalize a univariate zero-inflated distribution.
##' The main functionality is to estimate graphical models using group-lasso penalized neighborhood selection.
