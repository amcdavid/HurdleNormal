abstract = {Upon microbial infection, specific Th1 or Th2 responses develop depending on the type of microbe. Here, we demonstrate that different microbial compounds polarize the maturation of human myeloid dendritic cells (DCs) into stably committed Th1 cell-promoting (DC1) or Th2 cell-promoting (DC2) effector DCs that polarize Th cells via different mechanisms. Protein extract derived from the helminth Schistosoma mansoni induced the development of DC2s that promote the development of Th2 cells via the enhanced expression of OX40 ligand. Likewise, toxin from the extracellular bacterium Vibrio cholerae induced development of DC2s as well, however, via an OX40 ligand-independent, still unknown mechanism. In contrast, toxin from the intracellular bacterium Bordetella pertussis induced the development of DC1s with enhanced IL-12 production, which promotes a Th1 cell development. Poly(I:C) (dsRNA, mimic for virus) induced the development of extremely potent Th1-inducing DC1, surprisingly, without an enhanced IL-12 production. The obtained DC1s and DC2s are genuine effector cells that stably express Th cell-polarizing factors and are unresponsive to further modulation. The data suggest that the molecular basis of Th1/Th2 polarization via DCs is unexpectedly diverse and is adapted to the nature of the microbial compounds.},

It is thought that a distinct CD4+ effector T cell subset, called T follicular helper cells (T(FH)), provides this help; however, the molecular requirements for T(FH) differentiation are unknown. We found that expression of the transcription factor Bcl6 in CD4+ T cells is both necessary and sufficient for in vivo T(FH) differentiation and T cell help to B cells in mice. In contrast, the transcription factor Blimp-1, an antagonist of Bcl6, inhibits T(FH) differentiation and help, thereby preventing B cell germinal center and antibody responses. These findings demonstrate that T(FH) cells are required for proper B cell responses in vivo and that Bcl6 and Blimp-1 play central but opposing roles in T(FH) differentiation.},

Here we demonstrate that BTLA expression on $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells is decreased in patients with M. tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Particularly, BTLA expression levels are likely critical for $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells to manifest and maintain an active central memory phenotype with high capacity for secretion of IFN-$\gamma$ and perforin, which are important for immune memory against TB infection. BTLA(high) $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells also exhibited higher capacity in response to Mtb peptide stimulation. In contrast to the role of BTLA played for negative regulation of immune responses, our data in the current studies suggest that BTLA expression on $\alpha$$\beta$ T cells is likely associated with protective immune memory against Mtb infection in the setting of patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. This previous unappreciated role for BTLA may have implications for prevention and treatment of patients with Mtb infection.},

abstract = {The Ca(2+) dependent transcription factor family known as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) has been shown to be important in T-cell immune responses. Because NFAT proteins have a weak DNA-binding capacity, they cooperate with other transcription factors at composite sites within the promoters of target genes. Recently, NFAT was shown to also be important for the induction of specific genetic programs that guide the differentiation and effector or regulatory activities of CD4(+) T helper subsets via the transcriptional regulation of their lineage-specific transcription factors, specifically T-bet (Th1), Gata3 (Th2), RORgammat (Th17), and Foxp3 (iTregs). In addition, the NFAT family governs the transcription of several signature cytokines, including their cytokine receptors. Subsequently, the integration of these complex intracellular signal transduction cascades is considered to critically determine the crosstalk between the T-cell receptor and receptors that are activated by both the adaptive and innate immune systems to determine pathways of T helper cell differentiation and function. Here, we carefully review the critical role of the established transcriptional partners and functional outcomes of these NFAT interactions in regard to the effector responses of these clinically relevant CD4(+) T helper subsets.},

abstract = {Abnormalities in B-lymphocyte CD40 ligand (CD154) expression have been described for a number of immunologic diseases, including B-cell lymphomas. Although functional analysis of the CD154 gene and protein has been extensive, little is known about the mechanisms controlling CD154 expression in activated T cells, and even less is known for normal and malignant B cells. In this study we describe the transcriptional mechanism controlling CD154 expression in large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL). We show that the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) transcription factor is also constitutively activated in LBCL. We demonstrate that the constitutively active NFATc1 and c-rel members of the NFAT and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) families of transcription factors, respectively, directly interact with each other, bind to the CD154 promoter, and synergistically activate CD154 gene transcription. Down-regulation of NFATc1 or c-rel with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or chemical inhibitors inhibits CD154 gene transcription and lymphoma cell growth. These findings suggest that targeting NF-kappaB and NFAT, by inhibiting the expression of these transcription factors, or interdicting their interaction may provide a therapeutic rationale for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma of B-cell origin, and possibly other disorders that display dysregulated CD154 expression.},

The strongest predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their clinical behaviour(1-3). Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however 70-80{\%} of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without it(4,5). None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported to date(6-12) allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used DNA microarray analysis supervised classification to identify a gene expression signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases ('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition, we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers. The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle, invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

Recently, single-cell RNA-sequencing has facilitated expression profiling of large numbers of single cells in parallel. To fully exploit these data, it is critical that suitable computational approaches are developed. One key challenge, especially pertinent when considering dividing populations of cells, is to understand the cell-cycle stage of each captured cell. Here we describe and compare five established supervised machine learning methods and a custom-built predictor for allocating cells to their cell-cycle stage on the basis of their transcriptome. In particular, we assess the impact of different normalisation strategies and the usage of prior knowledge on the predictive power of the classifiers. We tested the methods on previously published datasets and found that a PCA-based approach and the custom predictor performed best. Moreover, our analysis shows that the performance depends strongly on normalisation and the usage of prior knowledge. Only by leveraging prior knowledge in form of cell-cycle annotated genes and by preprocessing the data using a rank-based normalisation, is it possible to robustly capture the transcriptional cell-cycle signature across different cell types, organisms and experimental protocols.},

Methods are needed to determine the significance of these changes while accounting for the enormous number of genes. We describe a method, Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), that assigns a score to each gene on the basis of change in gene expression relative to the standard deviation of repeated measurements. For genes with scores greater than an adjustable threshold, SAM uses permutations of the repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance, the false discovery rate (FDR). When the transcriptional response of human cells to ionizing radiation was measured by microarrays, SAM identified 34 genes that changed at least 1.5-fold with an estimated FDR of 12{\%}, compared with FDRs of 60 and 84{\%} by using conventional methods of analysis. Of the 34 genes, 19 were involved in cell cycle regulation and 3 in apoptosis. Surprisingly, four nucleotide excision repair genes were induced, suggesting that this repair pathway for UV-damaged DNA might play a previously unrecognized role in repairing DNA damaged by ionizing radiation.},

These results require no (e.g. exchangeability) assumptions on the underlying model or on the quality of the original selection procedure.

Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables. We study and propose efficient algorithms for the extensions of these methods for factor selection and show that these extensions give superior performance to the traditional stepwise backward elimination method in factor selection problems. We study the similarities and the differences between these methods. Simulations and real examples are used to illustrate the methods.},

abstract = {Next generation sequencing is quickly replacing microarrays as a technique to probe different molecular levels of the cell, such as DNA or RNA. The technology provides higher resolution, while reducing bias. RNA sequencing results in counts of RNA strands. This type of data imposes new statistical challenges. We present a novel, generic approach to model and analyze such data. Our approach aims at large flexibility of the likelihood (count) model and the regression model alike. Hence, a variety of count models is supported, such as the popular NB model, which accounts for overdispersion. In addition, complex, non-balanced designs and random effects are accommodated. Like some other methods, our method provides shrinkage of dispersion-related parameters. However, we extend it by enabling joint shrinkage of parameters, including those for which inference is desired. We argue that this is essential for Bayesian multiplicity correction. Shrinkage is effectuated by empirically estimating priors. We discuss several parametric (mixture) and non-parametric priors and develop procedures to estimate (parameters of) those. Inference is provided by means of local and Bayesian false discovery rates. We illustrate our method on several simulations and two data sets, also to compare it with other methods. Model- and data-based simulations show substantial improvements in the sensitivity at the given specificity. The data motivate the use of the ZI-NB as a powerful alternative to the NB, which results in higher detection rates for low-count data. Finally, compared with other methods, the results on small sample subsets are more reproducible when validated on their large sample complements, illustrating the importance of the type of shrinkage.},

Cell-subset responses are quantified by posterior probabilities, and human subject-level responses are quantified by two summary statistics that describe the quality of an individual's polyfunctional response and can be correlated directly with clinical outcome. Using three clinical data sets of cytokine production, we demonstrate how COMPASS improves characterization of antigen-specific T cells and reveals cellular 'correlates of protection/immunity' in the RV144 HIV vaccine efficacy trial that are missed by other methods.

abstract = {Between 1958, when Tobin's article appeared, and 1970, the Tobit model was used infrequently in econometric applications, but since the early 1970's numerous applications ranging over a wide area of economics have appeared and continue to appear. At the same time, many generalizations of the Tobit model and various estimation methods for these models have been proposed. In fact, models and estimation methods are now so numerous and diverse that it is difficult for econometricians to keep track of all the existing models and estimation methods and maintain a clear notion of their relative merits. Thus, it is now particularly useful to examine the current situation and prepare a unified summary and critical assessment of existing results. I will try to accomplish this objective by means of classifying the diverse Tobit models into five basic types. (My review of the empirical literature suggests that roughly 95{\%} of the econometric applications of Tobit models fall into one of these five types.) While there are many ways to classify Tobit models, I have chosen to classify them according to the form of the likelihood function. This way seems to me to be the statistically most useful classification because a similarity in the likelihood function implies a similarity in the appropriate estimation and computation methods. It is interesting to note that two models which superficially seem to be very different from each other can be shown to belong to the same type when they are classified according to my scheme.},

abstract = {Vaccinia virus immunization provides lifelong protection against smallpox, but the mechanisms of this exquisite protection are unknown. We used polychromatic flow cytometry to characterize the functional and phenotypic profile of CD8(+) T cells induced by vaccinia virus immunization in a comparative vaccine trial of modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) versus Dryvax immunization in which protection was assessed against subsequent Dryvax challenge. Vaccinia virus-specific CD8(+) T cells induced by both MVA and Dryvax were highly polyfunctional; they degranulated and produced interferon gamma, interleukin 2, macrophage inflammatory protein 1beta, and tumor necrosis factor alpha after antigenic stimulation. Responding CD8(+) T cells exhibited an unusual phenotype (CD45RO(-)CD27(intermediate)). The unique phenotype and high degree of polyfunctionality induced by vaccinia virus also extended to inserted HIV gene products of recombinant NYVAC. This quality of the CD8(+) T cell response may be at least partially responsible for the profound efficacy of these vaccines in protection against smallpox and serves as a benchmark against which other vaccines can be evaluated.},

Sequencing data for such studies are produced more and more often, implying challenges for the analysis, such as excess of zeros, presence of random effects and multi-parameter inference. Moreover, when sample sizes are small, inference is likely to be too liberal when, in a Bayesian setting, applying a non-appropriate prior or to lack power when not carefully borrowing information across features.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We show on microRNA sequencing data from a clinical cancer study how our software ShrinkBayes tackles the aforementioned challenges.

abstract = {Dendritic cells (DCs) express cell surface lectins that are potentially involved in the recognition, uptake, and presentation of glycosylated foreign substances. A unique calcium-type (C-type) lectin, the macrophage galactose (Gal)-type C-type lectin (MGL/CD301) expressed on DCs, is thought to participate in the recognition of molecules from both altered self and pathogens due to its monosaccharide specificity for Gal and N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc). Although mice have two MGL genes, Mgl1 and Mgl2, their distinct roles have not been previously explored. The present report characterizes the properties of MGL2 by examining its distribution and its role in antigen presentation by DCs. We generated an MGL2-specific monoclonal antibody and examined MGL2 expression in tissues by immunohistochemistry and in isolated cells by flow cytometry. The cells reactive with this antibody were shown to be a portion of MGL1-expressing cells, mostly conventional DCs. Internalization of soluble polyacrylamide polymers (PAA) with alpha-GalNAc residues (GalNAc-PAA) by bone marrow-derived DCs (BM-DCs) was mediated by MGL2, as revealed by a comparison of Mgl1(-/-) and Mgl2(-/-) BM-DCs with wild-type BM-DCs. Biotinylated GalNAc-PAA conjugated to streptavidin (SAv) was more efficiently presented to SAv-primed T cells by BM-DCs than beta-N-acetylglucosamine-PAA conjugated to SAv or SAv alone as shown by thymidine uptake and cytokine production. This is the first report that demonstrates the involvement of GalNAc residues in antigen uptake and presentation by DCs that lead to CD4(+) T cell activation.},

abstract = {Thymic stromal cells, including cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTEC) produce many humoral factors, such as cytokines and eicosanoids to modulate thymocyte homeostasis, thereby regulating the peripheral immune responses. In this study, we identified fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4), an intracellular fatty acid chaperone, in the mouse thymus, and examined its role in the control of cytokine production in comparison with FABP5. By immunofluorescent staining, FABP4(+) cells enclosing the thymocytes were scattered throughout the thymic cortex with a spatial difference from the FABP5(+) cell that were distributed widely throughout the cTEC. The FABP4(+) cells were immunopositive for MHC class II, NLDC145 and cytokeratin 8, and were identified as part of cTEC. The FABP4(+) cells were identified as thymic nurse cells (TNC), a subpopulation of cTEC, by their active phagocytosis of apoptotic thymocytes. Furthermore, FABP4 expression was confirmed in the isolated TNC at the gene and protein levels. To explore the function of FABP in TNC, TSt-4/DLL1 cells stably expressing either FABP4 or FABP5 were established and the gene expressions of various cytokines were examined. The gene expression of interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-18 was increased both in FABP4 and FABP5 over-expressing cells compared with controls, and moreover, the increase in their expressions by adding of stearic acids was significantly enhanced in the FABP4 over-expressing cells. These data suggest that both FABPs are involved in the maintenance of T lymphocyte homeostasis through the modulation of cytokine production, which is possibly regulated by cellular fatty acid-mediated signaling in TEC, including TNC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In most measurements of gene expression, mRNA is first reverse-transcribed into cDNA. We studied the reverse transcription reaction and its consequences for quantitative measurements of gene expression. METHODS: We used SYBR green I-based quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) to measure the properties of reverse transcription reaction for the beta-tubulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Glut2, CaV1D, and insulin II genes, using random hexamers, oligo(dT), and gene-specific reverse transcription primers. RESULTS: Experimental variation in reverse transcription-QPCR (RT-QPCR) was mainly attributable to the reverse transcription step. Reverse transcription efficiency depended on priming strategy, and the dependence was different for the five genes studied. Reverse transcription yields also depended on total RNA concentration. CONCLUSIONS: RT-QPCR gene expression measurements are comparable only when the same priming strategy and reaction conditions are used in all experiments and the samples contain the same total amount of RNA. Experimental accuracy is improved by running samples in (at least) duplicate starting with the reverse transcription reaction},

Here we provide a detailed protocol for stochastic profiling, a method that infers single-cell regulatory heterogeneities by repeatedly sampling small collections of cells selected at random. Repeated stochastic sampling is performed by laser-capture microdissection or limiting dilution, followed by careful exponential cDNA amplification, hybridization to microarrays and statistical analysis. Stochastic profiling surveys the transcriptome for programs that are heterogeneously regulated among cellular subpopulations in their native tissue context. The protocol is readily optimized for specific biological applications and takes about 1 week to complete.},

The technique, called stochastic profiling, involves repeated, random selection of very small cell populations via laser-capture microdissection followed by a customized single-cell amplification procedure and transcriptional profiling. Fluctuations in the resulting gene-expression measurements are then analyzed statistically to identify transcripts that are heterogeneously coexpressed. We stochastically profiled matrix-attached human epithelial cells in a three-dimensional culture model of mammary-acinar morphogenesis. Of 4,557 transcripts, we identified 547 genes with strong cell-to-cell expression differences. Clustering of this heterogeneous subset revealed several molecular 'programs' implicated in protein biosynthesis, oxidative-stress responses and NF-kappaB signaling, which we independently confirmed by RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization. Thus, stochastic profiling can reveal single-cell heterogeneities without the need to measure expression in individual cells.},

Loss of HOXA1 results in significant expression level changes in thousands of individual transcripts, along with isoform switching events in key regulators of the cell cycle.

RESULTS: We develop a statistical framework for studying the kinetics of stochastic gene expression from single-cell RNA-seq data. By applying our model to a single-cell RNA-seq dataset generated by profiling mouse embryonic stemcells, we find that the inferred kinetic parameters are consistent with RNA polymerase II binding and chromatinmodifications. Our results suggest that histone modifications affect transcriptional bursting by modulating bothburst size and frequency. Furthermore, we show that our model can be used to identify genes with slow promoterkinetics, which are important for probabilistic differentiation of embryonic stem cells. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the proposed statistical model provides a flexible and efficient way to investigate the kinetics of transcription.},

However, these experiments are prone to high levels of unexplained technical noise, creating new challenges for identifying genes that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model where: (i) cell-specific normalisation constants are estimated as part of the model parameters, (ii) technical variability is quantified based on spike-in genes that are artificially introduced to each analysed cell's lysate and (iii) the total variability of the expression counts is decomposed into technical and biological components. BASiCS also provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable genes within the population of cells under study. This is formalised by means of tail posterior probabilities associated to high (or low) biological cell-to-cell variance contributions, quantities that can be easily interpreted by users. We demonstrate our method using gene expression measurements from mouse Embryonic Stem Cells. Cross-validation and meaningful enrichment of gene ontology categories within genes classified as highly (or lowly) variable supports the efficacy of our approach.},

Here we develop an estimator of the error variance that can borrow information across genes using the James-Stein shrinkage concept. A new test statistic (FS) is constructed using this estimator. The new statistic is compared with other statistics used to test for differential expression: the gene-specific F test (F1), the pooled-variance F statistic (F3), a hybrid statistic (F2) that uses the average of the individual and pooled variances, the regularized t-statistic, the posterior odds statistic B, and the SAM t-test. The FS-test shows best or nearly best power for detecting differentially expressed genes over a wide range of simulated data in which the variance components associated with individual genes are either homogeneous or heterogeneous. Thus FS provides a powerful and robust approach to test differential expression of genes that utilizes information not available in individual gene testing approaches and does not suffer from biases of the pooled variance approach.},

Even though data produced from these technologies are proving to be the most informative of any thus far, very little attention has been paid to fundamental design aspects of data collection and analysis, namely sampling, randomization, replication, and blocking. We discuss these concepts in an RNA sequencing framework. Using simulations we demonstrate the benefits of collecting replicated RNA sequencing data according to well known statistical designs that partition the sources of biological and technical variation. Examples of these designs and their corresponding models are presented with the goal of testing differential expression.},

abstract = {It is now known that unwanted noise and unmodeled artifacts such as batch effects can dramatically reduce the accuracy of statistical inference in genomic experiments. These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data. These updates are available through the sva Bioconductor package and I have made fully reproducible analysis using these methods available from: https://github.com/jtleek/svaseq.},

Systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies. Surprisingly, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-Seq technology. We examined data from five published studies and found that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we found that the proportion of genes reported as expressed explains a substantial part of observed variability and that this quantity varies systematically across experimental batches. Furthermore, we found that the implemented experimental designs confounded outcomes of interest with batch effects, a design that can bring into question some of the conclusions of these studies. Finally, we propose a simple experimental design that can ameliorate the effect of theses systematic errors have on downstream results.},

@article{Eden2009-di,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Since the inception of the GO annotation project, a variety of tools have been developed that support exploring and searching the GO database. In particular, a variety of tools that perform GO enrichment analysis are currently available. Most of these tools require as input a target set of genes and a background set and seek enrichment in the target set compared to the background set. A few tools also exist that support analyzing ranked lists. The latter typically rely on simulations or on union-bound correction for assigning statistical significance to the results. RESULTS:GOrilla is a web-based application that identifies enriched GO terms in ranked lists of genes, without requiring the user to provide explicit target and background sets. This is particularly useful in many typical cases where genomic data may be naturally represented as a ranked list of genes (e.g. by level of expression or of differential expression). GOrilla employs a flexible threshold statistical approach to discover GO terms that are significantly enriched at the top of a ranked gene list. Building on a complete theoretical characterization of the underlying distribution, called mHG, GOrilla computes an exact p-value for the observed enrichment, taking threshold multiple testing into account without the need for simulations. This enables rigorous statistical analysis of thousand of genes and thousands of GO terms in order of seconds. The output of the enrichment analysis is visualized as a hierarchical structure, providing a clear view of the relations between enriched GO terms. CONCLUSION:GOrilla is an efficient GO analysis tool with unique features that make a useful addition to the existing repertoire of GO enrichment tools. GOrilla's unique features and advantages over other threshold free enrichment tools include rigorous statistics, fast running time and an effective graphical representation. GOrilla is publicly available at: http://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il},

Both stochasticity inherent in the biochemical process of gene expression (intrinsic noise) and fluctuations in other cellular components (extrinsic noise) contribute substantially to overall variation. Transcription rate, regulatory dynamics, and genetic factors control the amplitude of noise. These results establish a quantitative foundation for modeling noise in genetic networks and reveal how low intracellular copy numbers of molecules can fundamentally limit the precision of gene regulation.},

It is unknown how these cells contribute to the clearance of an infection. We measured the strength of T cell receptor (TCR) signals that bystander-activated, cytotoxic CD8 T cells (BA-CTLs) receive in vivo and found evidence of limited TCR signaling. Given this marginal contribution of the TCR, we asked how BA-CTLs identify infected target cells. We show that target cells express NKG2D ligands following bacterial infection and demonstrate that BA-CTLs directly eliminate these target cells in an innate-like, NKG2D-dependent manner. Selective inhibition of BA-CTL-mediated killing led to a significant defect in pathogen clearance. Together, these data suggest an innate role for memory CD8 T cells in the early immune response before the onset of a de novo generated, antigen-specific CD8 T cell response.},

Covariance selection aims at estimating those structural zeros from data. We show that neighborhood selection with the Lasso is a computationally attractive alternative to standard covariance selection for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Neighborhood selection estimates the conditional independence restrictions separately for each node in the graph and is hence equivalent to variable selection for Gaussian linear models. We show that the proposed neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Consistency hinges on the choice of the penalty parameter. The oracle value for optimal prediction does not lead to a consistent neighborhood estimate. Controlling instead the probability of falsely joining some distinct connectivity components of the graph, consistent estimation for sparse graphs is achieved (with exponential rates), even when the number of variables grows as the number of observations raised to an arbitrary power.},

Despite great progress recently, substantial challenges remain, including discriminating biological variation from technical noise. Here we apply the SMART-seq single-cell RNA-seq protocol to study the reference lymphoblastoid cell line GM12878. By using spike-in quantification standards, we estimate the absolute number of RNA molecules per cell for each gene and find significant variation in total mRNA content: between 50,000 and 300,000 transcripts per cell. We directly measure technical stochasticity by a pool/split design and find that there are significant differences in expression between individual cells, over and above technical variation. Specific gene coexpression modules were preferentially expressed in subsets of individual cells, including one enriched for mRNA processing and splicing factors. We assess cell-to-cell variation in alternative splicing and allelic bias and report evidence of significant differences in splice site usage that exceed splice variation in the pool/split comparison. Finally, we show that transcriptomes from small pools of 30-100 cells approach the information content and reproducibility of contemporary RNA-seq from large amounts of input material. Together, our results define an experimental and computational path forward for analyzing gene expression in rare cell types and cell states.},

Here we did systems analyses of immune responses to the polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines against meningococcus in healthy adults, in the broader context of published studies of vaccines against yellow fever virus and influenza virus. To achieve this, we did a large-scale network integration of publicly available human blood transcriptomes and systems-scale databases in specific biological contexts and deduced a set of transcription modules in blood. Those modules revealed distinct transcriptional signatures of antibody responses to different classes of vaccines, which provided key insights into primary viral, protein recall and anti-polysaccharide responses. Our results elucidate the early transcriptional programs that orchestrate vaccine immunity in humans and demonstrate the power of integrative network modeling.},

Although a role for Egr2 is well established in T-cell development, Egr2 expression and its biological function in dendritic cells (DCs) have not yet been described. Here, we demonstrate Egr2 expression during DC development, and its role in DC-mediated immune responses. Egr2 is expressed in the later stage of DC development from BM precursor cells. Even at steady state, Egr2 is highly expressed in mouse splenic DCs. Egr2-knockdown (Egr2-KD) DCs showed increased levels of major histocompatability complex (MHC) class I and II and co-stimulatory molecules, and enhanced antigen uptake and migratory capacities. Furthermore, Egr2-KD abolished SOCS1 expression and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation during DC development, probably resulting in the enhancement of IL-12 expression and Th1 immunogenicity of a DC vaccine. DC-mediated cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation and antitumor immunity were significantly enhanced by Egr2-KD, and impaired by Egr2 overexpression in antigen-pulsed DC vaccines. These data suggest that Egr2 acts as an intrinsic negative regulator of DC immunogenicity and can be an attractive molecular target for DC vaccine development.},

set supports quantitative biology and affords unique insights
into cell regulation. Although mRNAs are typically expressed
in a narrow range above 1 copy/cell, most long, noncoding
RNAs, except for a distinct subset, are tightly repressed
below 1 copy/cell. Cell-cycle-regulated transcription tunes
mRNA numbers to phase-specific requirements but can also bring
about more switch-like expression. Proteins greatly exceed
mRNAs in abundance and dynamic range, and concentrations are
regulated to functional demands. Upon transition to
quiescence, the proteome changes substantially, but, in stark
contrast to mRNAs, proteins do not uniformly decrease but
scale with cell volume.},

abstract = {Individual mammalian cells exhibit large variability in cellular volume, even with the same absolute DNA content, and so must compensate for differences in DNA concentration in order to maintain constant concentration of gene expression products. Using single-molecule counting and computational image analysis, we show that transcript abundance correlates with cellular volume at the single-cell level due to increased global transcription in larger cells. Cell fusion experiments establish that increased cellular content itself can directly increase transcription. Quantitative analysis shows that this mechanism measures the ratio of cellular volume to DNA content, most likely through sequestration of a transcriptional factor to DNA. Analysis of transcriptional bursts reveals a separate mechanism for gene dosage compensation after DNA replication that enables proper transcriptional output during early and late S phase. Our results provide a framework for quantitatively understanding the relationships among DNA content, cell size, and gene expression variability in single cells.},

single-molecule kinetics. Often, it occurs in a bursty,

@article{Li2011-sv,
abstract = {BACKGROUND:RNA-Seq is revolutionizing the way transcript abundances are measured. A key challenge in transcript quantification from RNA-Seq data is the handling of reads that map to multiple genes or isoforms. This issue is particularly important for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies in the absence of sequenced genomes, as it is difficult to determine which transcripts are isoforms of the same gene. A second significant issue is the design of RNA-Seq experiments, in terms of the number of reads, read length, and whether reads come from one or both ends of cDNA fragments. RESULTS:We present RSEM, an user-friendly software package for quantifying gene and isoform abundances from single-end or paired-end RNA-Seq data. RSEM outputs abundance estimates, 95{\%} credibility intervals, and visualization files and can also simulate RNA-Seq data. In contrast to other existing tools, the software does not require a reference genome. Thus, in combination with a de novo transcriptome assembler, RSEM enables accurate transcript quantification for species without sequenced genomes. On simulated and real data sets, RSEM has superior or comparable performance to quantification methods that rely on a reference genome. Taking advantage of RSEM's ability to effectively use ambiguously-mapping reads, we show that accurate gene-level abundance estimates are best obtained with large numbers of short single-end reads. On the other hand, estimates of the relative frequencies of isoforms within single genes may be improved through the use of paired-end reads, depending on the number of possible splice forms for each gene. CONCLUSIONS:RSEM is an accurate and user-friendly software tool for quantifying transcript abundances from RNA-Seq data. As it does not rely on the existence of a reference genome, it is particularly useful for quantification with de novo transcriptome assemblies. In addition, RSEM has enabled valuable guidance for cost-efficient design of quantification experiments with RNA-Seq, which is currently relatively expensive.},

abstract = {NK cells are key regulators of innate defense against mouse CMV (MCMV). Like NK cells, NKT cells also produce high levels of IFN-{\$}\gamma{\$} rapidly after MCMV infection. However, whether similar mechanisms govern activation of these two cell types, as well as the significance of NKT cells for host resistance, remain unknown. In this article, we show that, although both NKT and NK cells are activated via cytokines, their particular cytokine requirements differ significantly in vitro and in vivo. IL-12 is required for NKT cell activation in vitro but is not sufficient, whereas NK cells have the capacity to be activated more promiscuously in response to individual cytokines from innate cells. In line with these results, GM-CSF-derived dendritic cells activated only NK cells upon MCMV infection, consistent with their virtual lack of IL-12 production, whereas Flt3 ligand-derived dendritic cells produced IL-12 and activated both NK and NKT cells. In vivo, NKT cell activation was abolished in IL-12(-/-) mice infected with MCMV, whereas NK cells were still activated. In turn, splenic NK cell activation was more IL-18 dependent. The differential requirements for IL-12 and IL-18 correlated with the levels of cytokine receptor expression by NK and NKT cells. Finally, mice lacking NKT cells showed reduced control of MCMV, and depleting NK cells further enhanced viral replication. Taken together, our results show that NKT and NK cells have differing requirements for cytokine-mediated activation, and both can contribute nonredundantly to MCMV defense, revealing that these two innate lymphocyte subsets function together to fine-tune antiviral responses.},

abstract = {Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) modulates the expression of several cytokines by human monocytes at the transcriptional level. In view of these findings, we analyzed the effects of IFN-gamma on the expression of different transcription factors in activated human monocytes. Priming of human monocytes with IFN-gamma resulted in the down regulation of c-fos and c-jun mRNA in response to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) compared to the effects of LPS alone. Not only was this effect observed at the mRNA level, but activator protein-1 (AP-1) DNA binding capacity was affected as well, A strong reduction was observed in the LPS-induced DNA-binding activity of AP-1 in the presence of IFN-gamma. LPS-stimulated monocytes showed an increased expression of p105 mRNA, the precursor of the p50 subunit of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), while no effect was noticed on the expression of p65 mRNA. In contrast, IFN-gamma priming did not affect the expression of p105 transcripts but enhanced the expression of p65 mRNA (two-fold). Priming with IFN-gamma followed by LPS stimulation resulted in a further increase in the expression of p65 mRNA. This was due to an increase in the half-life of p65 mRNA (75 vs 150 minutes). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) demonstrated that unstimulated monocytes predominantly expressed p50 NF-kappa B. Stimulation with LPS or IFN-gamma resulted in the expression of p50 and p65 subunits, while the combination of IFN-gamma plus LPS caused a further increase in the expression of NF-kappa B. With Western blotting, it was shown that nuclear extracts from monocytes contained p50 and p65 protein in response to LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation. However, the combined stimulation did not result in enhanced p50 and p65 protein expression. The effects of IFN-gamma on the transcription factors were specific, since no change was observed in the expression of NF-IL-6 or I kappa B alpha, the inhibitor of NF-kappa B. We conclude that the effects of IFN-gamma on the expression of the transcription factors AP-1 and NF-kappa B may be important for the modulatory effects of IFN-gamma on the cytokine expression in activated human monocytes.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cell populations are never truly homogeneous; individual cells exist in biochemical states that define functional differences between them. New technology based on microfluidic arrays combined with multiplexed quantitative polymerase chain reactions now enables high-throughput single-cell gene expression measurement, allowing assessment of cellular heterogeneity. However, few analytic tools have been developed specifically for the statistical and analytical challenges of single-cell quantitative polymerase chain reactions data. RESULTS: We present a statistical framework for the exploration, quality control and analysis of single-cell gene expression data from microfluidic arrays. We assess accuracy and within-sample heterogeneity of single-cell expression and develop quality control criteria to filter unreliable cell measurements. We propose a statistical model accounting for the fact that genes at the single-cell level can be on (and a continuous expression measure is recorded) or dichotomously off (and the recorded expression is zero). Based on this model, we derive a combined likelihood ratio test for differential expression that incorporates both the discrete and continuous components. Using an experiment that examines treatment-specific changes in expression, we show that this combined test is more powerful than either the continuous or dichotomous component in isolation, or a t-test on the zero-inflated data. Although developed for measurements from a specific platform (Fluidigm), these tools are generalizable to other multi-parametric measures over large numbers of events.

abstract = {Human memory CD8(+) T cell subsets, termed central memory and effector memory T cells, can be identified by expression of CD45RA, CD62 ligand (CD62L), and CCR7. Accordingly, functional differences have been described for each subset, reflecting unique roles in immunological memory. The common gamma-chain cytokines IL-15 and IL-7 have been shown to induce proliferation and differentiation of human CD8(+) T cell subsets, as well as increased effector functions (i.e., cytokines, cytotoxicity). In this study, we observed that addition of IL-15 or IL-7 to cultures of human CD8(+) T cells profoundly enhanced the IL-12-IL-18 pathway of IFN-gamma production. Importantly, IL-15 and IL-7 lowered the threshold concentrations of IL-12 and IL-18 required for induction of IFN-gamma by 100-fold. Comparison of IL-15 and IL-7 demonstrated that IL-15 was superior in its ability to enhance IL-12-IL-18-induced IFN-gamma, without evidence of a synergistic effect between IL-15 and IL-7. We also observed that IL-15- and IL-7-mediated enhancement of IL-12-IL-18-induced IFN-gamma production was a functional property of effector memory CD8(+) T cells. Despite a lack of association between cell division and acquisition of IL-12-IL-18-induced IFN-gamma, down-regulation of CD62L expression correlated well with increased IL-12-IL-18-induced IFN-gamma. Purified central memory T cells stimulated with IL-15 and IL-7 down-regulated CD62L and acquired potent IL-12-IL-18-induced IFN-gamma similar to effector memory T cells. Thus, in addition to its known role in development of T cell memory, IL-15 may amplify memory CD8(+) T cell effector functions by increasing sensitivity to proinflammatory cytokine stimulation.},

Existing methods for finding the group lasso estimator either use gradient projection methods to update the entire coefficient vector simultaneously at each step, or update one group of coefficients at a time using an inexact line search to approximate the optimal value for the group of coefficients when all other groups' coefficients are fixed. We present a new method of computation for the group lasso in the linear regression case, the Single Line Search (SLS) algorithm, which operates by computing the exact optimal value for each group (when all other coefficients are fixed) with one univariate line search. We perform simulations demonstrating that the SLS algorithm is often more efficient than existing computational methods.

They are very generally applicable, but are especially well-suited to problems of substantial recent interest involving large or high-dimensional datasets. Proximal methods sit at a higher level of abstraction than classical al- gorithms like Newton's method: the base operation is evaluating the proximal operator of a function, which itself involves solving a small convex optimization problem. These subproblems, which generalize the problem of projecting a point onto a convex set, often admit closed- form solutions or can be solved very quickly with standard or simple specialized methods. Here, we discuss the many different interpreta- tions of proximal operators and algorithms, describe their connections to many other topics in optimization and applied mathematics, survey some popular algorithms, and provide a large number of examples of proximal operators that commonly arise in practice.},

abstract = {A new class of continuous multivariate distributions on X ∈ Rn is proposed. We define these so-called $\nu$-spherical distributions through properties of the density function in a location-scale context. We derive conditions for properness of $\nu$-spherical distributions and discuss how to generate them in practice. The name "$\nu$-spherical" is motivated by the fact that these distributions generalize the classes of spherical (when $\nu$({\textperiodcentered}) is the l2 norm) and lq-spherical (when $\nu$({\textperiodcentered}) is the lq norm) distributions. Isodensity sets are still always situated around the location parameter $\mu$, but exchangeability and axial symmetry are no longer imposed, as is illustrated in some examples. As an important special case, we define a class of distributions suggested by independent sampling from a generalization of exponential power distributions. This allows us to model skewness. Interestingly, all the robustness results found previously for spherical and lq-spherical models carry over directly to $\nu$-spherical models. In particular, it is shown that under a common improper prior on the scale parameter $\tau$-1, any $\nu$-spherical distribution with the same isodensity sets will lead to the same density p(X,$\mu$). Under proper priors on $\tau$, we can still find some robustness results, although of lesser generality. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1995 American Statistical Association},

@article{Kramer2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Graphical Gaussian models are popular tools for the estimation of (undirected) gene association networks from microarray data. A key issue when the number of variables greatly exceeds the number of samples is the estimation of the matrix of partial correlations. Since the (Moore-Penrose) inverse of the sample covariance matrix leads to poor estimates in this scenario, standard methods are inappropriate and adequate regularization techniques are needed. Popular approaches include biased estimates of the covariance matrix and high-dimensional regression schemes, such as the Lasso and Partial Least Squares. RESULTS: In this article, we investigate a general framework for combining regularized regression methods with the estimation of Graphical Gaussian models. This framework includes various existing methods as well as two new approaches based on ridge regression and adaptive lasso, respectively. These methods are extensively compared both qualitatively and quantitatively within a simulation study and through an application to six diverse real data sets. In addition, all proposed algorithms are implemented in the R package "parcor", available from the R repository CRAN. CONCLUSION: In our simulation studies, the investigated non-sparse regression methods, i.e. Ridge Regression and Partial Least Squares, exhibit rather conservative behavior when combined with (local) false discovery rate multiple testing in order to decide whether or not an edge is present in the network. For networks with higher densities, the difference in performance of the methods decreases. For sparse networks, we confirm the Lasso's well known tendency towards selecting too many edges, whereas the two-stage adaptive Lasso is an interesting alternative that provides sparser solutions. In our simulations, both sparse and non-sparse methods are able to reconstruct networks with cluster structures. On six real data sets, we also clearly distinguish the results obtained using the non-sparse methods and those obtained using the sparse methods where specification of the regularization parameter automatically means model selection. In five out of six data sets, Partial Least Squares selects very dense networks. Furthermore, for data that violate the assumption of uncorrelated observations (due to replications), the Lasso and the adaptive Lasso yield very complex structures, indicating that they might not be suited under these conditions. The shrinkage approach is more stable than the regression based approaches when using subsampling.},

Most previous work assumed that the variables are multivariate Gaussian or that the conditional means of the variables are linearly related. Unfortunately, if these assumptions are violated, the resulting conditional independence estimates can be inaccurate. We propose a semiparametric method, graph estimation with joint additive models, which allows the conditional means of the features to take an arbitrary additive form. We present an efficient algorithm for computation of our estimator, and prove that it is consistent. We extend our method to estimation of directed graphs with known causal ordering. Using simulated data, we show that our method performs better than existing methods when there are nonlinear relationships among the features, and is comparable to methods that assume multivariate normality when the conditional means are linear. We illustrate our method on a cell signalling dataset.},

abstract = {Advances in high-throughput, single cell gene expression are allowing interrogation of cell heterogeneity. However, there is concern that the cell cycle phase of a cell might bias characterizations of gene expression at the single-cell level. We assess the effect of cell cycle phase on gene expression in single cells by measuring 333 genes in 930 cells across three phases and three cell lines. We determine each cell's phase non-invasively without chemical arrest and use it as a covariate in tests of differential expression. We observe bi-modal gene expression, a previously-described phenomenon, wherein the expression of otherwise abundant genes is either strongly positive, or undetectable within individual cells. This bi-modality is likely both biologically and technically driven. Irrespective of its source, we show that it should be modeled to draw accurate inferences from single cell expression experiments. To this end, we propose a semi-continuous modeling framework based on the generalized linear model, and use it to characterize genes with consistent cell cycle effects across three cell lines. Our new computational framework improves the detection of previously characterized cell-cycle genes compared to approaches that do not account for the bi-modality of single-cell data. We use our semi-continuous modelling framework to estimate single cell gene co-expression networks. These networks suggest that in addition to having phase-dependent shifts in expression (when averaged over many cells), some, but not all, canonical cell cycle genes tend to be co-expressed in groups in single cells. We estimate the amount of single cell expression variability attributable to the cell cycle. We find that the cell cycle explains only 5{\%}-17{\%} of expression variability, suggesting that the cell cycle will not tend to be a large nuisance factor in analysis of the single cell transcriptome.},

The group lasso estimator for logistic regression is shown to be statistically consistent even if the number of predictors is much larger than sam- ple size but with sparse true underlying structure.We further use a two-stage procedure which aims for sparser models than the group lasso, leading to improved prediction performance for some cases. Moreover, owing to the two-stage nature, the estimates can be constructed to be hierarchical.The methods are used on simulated and real data sets about splice site detection in DNA sequences.},

Next we establish the consistency of the neighbourhood selection approach for graph reconstruction in high dimensions when the true underlying graph is sparse. Motivated by our theoretical results, we investigate the selection of edges between nodes of two different types, and show that efficiency can be gained if edge estimates obtained from the regressions of particular node types are used to reconstruct the graph. These results are illustrated with examples of Gaussian, binary, Poisson and exponential distributions. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by evidence from simulation studies. We apply the proposed method and competing approaches to a yeast eQTL data set consisting of gene expression and DNA sequence data.},

abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

abstract = {Motivation: High-throughput single-cell qPCR is a promising technique allowing for new insights in complex cellular processes. However, the PCR reaction can only be detected up to a certain detection limit, while failed reactions could be due to low or absent expression and the true expression level is unknown. As this censoring can occur for high proportions of the data, it is one of the main challenges when dealing with single-cell qPCR data. PCA is an important tool for visualising the structure of high-dimensional data as well as for identifying sub-populations of cells. However, to date it is not clear how to perform a PCA of censored data. We present a probabilistic approach which accounts for the censoring and evaluate it for two typical data-sets containing single-cell qPCR data. Results: We use the Gaussian Process Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) framework to account for censoring by introducing an appropriate noise model and allowing a different kernel for each dimension.We evaluate this new approach for two typical qPCR data- sets (of mouse embryonic stem cells and blood stem/progenitor cells respectively) by performing linear and non-linear probabilistic PCA. Taking the censoring into account results in a 2D representation of the data which better reflects its known structure: in both data-sets our new approach results in a better separation of known cell types and is able to reveal subpopulations in one data-set which could not be resolved using standard PCA. Availability: The implementation was based on the existing GPLVM toolbox1; extensions for noise models and kernels accounting for censoring are available from http://icb.helmholtz- muenchen.de/censgplvm.},

abstract = {Markov Random Fields, or undirected graph- ical models are widely used to model high- dimensional multivariate data. Classical in- stances of these models, such as Gaussian Graphical and Ising Models, as well as re- cent extensions (Yang et al., 2012) to graph- ical models specified by univariate expo- nential families, assume all variables arise from the same distribution. Complex data from high-throughput genomics and social networking for example, often contain dis- crete, count, and continuous variables mea- sured on the same set of samples. To model such heterogeneous data, we develop a novel class of mixed graphical models by specify- ing that each node-conditional distribution is a member of a possibly different univari- ate exponential family. We study several in- stances of our model, and propose scalable M-estimators for recovering the underlying network structure. Simulations as well as an application to learning mixed genomic net- works from next generation sequencing and mutation data demonstrate the versatility of our methods. 1},

Treating the covariates as random and adopting an asymptotic scenario in which p increases with n, we show that Bayesian model selection using certain priors on the set of models is asymptotically equivalent to selecting a model using an extended Bayesian information criterion. Moreover, we prove that the smallest true model is selected by either of these methods with probability tending to one. Having addressed random covariates, we are also able to give a consistency result for pseudo-likelihood approaches to high-dimensional sparse graphical modeling. Experiments on real data demonstrate good performance of the extended Bayesian information criterion for regression and for graphical models.},

@article{McCarthy2012,
abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

We provide a detailed evaluation of statistical methods for normalization and differential expression (DE) analysis of Illumina transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data.
                      We compare statistical methods for detecting genes that are significantly DE between two types of biological samples and find that there are substantial differences in how the test statistics handle low-count genes. We evaluate how DE results are affected by features of the sequencing platform, such as, varying gene lengths, base-calling calibration method (with and without phi X control lane), and flow-cell/library preparation effects. We investigate the impact of the read count normalization method on DE results and show that the standard approach of scaling by total lane counts (e.g., RPKM) can bias estimates of DE. We propose more general quantile-based normalization procedures and demonstrate an improvement in DE detection.
                      Our results have significant practical and methodological implications for the design and analysis of mRNA-Seq experiments. They highlight the importance of appropriate statistical methods for normalization and DE inference, to account for features of the sequencing platform that could impact the accuracy of results.

One consequence of this fact is that the copy number of any given protein varies substantially from cell to cell, even within isogenic populations. Recent experiments have measured this variation for thousands of different proteins, revealing a linear relationship between variance and mean level of expression for much of the proteome. This simple relationship is frequently thought to arise from the random production and degradation of mRNAs, but several lines of evidence suggest that infrequent gene activation events also bear responsibility. In support of the latter hypothesis, single-molecule experiments have demonstrated that mRNA transcripts are often produced in large bursts. Moreover, the temporal pattern of these bursts appears to be correlated for chromosomally proximal genes, suggesting the existence of an upstream player.},

abstract = {Summary We consider the problem of identifying differentially expressed genes under different conditions using gene expression microarrays. Because of the many steps involved in the experimental process, from hybridization to image analysis, cDNA microarray data often contain outliers. For example, an outlying data value could occur because of scratches or dust on the surface, imperfections in the glass, or imperfections in the array production. We develop a robust Bayesian hierarchical model for testing for differential expression. Errors are modeled explicitly using a t-distribution, which accounts for outliers. The model includes an exchangeable prior for the variances, which allows different variances for the genes but still shrinks extreme empirical variances. Our model can be used for testing for differentially expressed genes among multiple samples, and it can distinguish between the different possible patterns of differential expression when there are three or more samples. Parameter estimation is carried out using a novel version of Markov chain Monte Carlo that is appropriate when the model puts mass on subspaces of the full parameter space. The method is illustrated using two publicly available gene expression data sets. We compare our method to six other baseline and commonly used techniques, namely the t-test, the Bonferroni-adjusted t-test, significance analysis of microarrays (SAM), Efron's empirical Bayes, and EBarrays in both its lognormal–normal and gamma–gamma forms. In an experiment with HIV data, our method performed better than these alternatives, on the basis of between-replicate agreement and disagreement.},

However, they can be experimentally cumbersome, their relative performances have not been evaluated systematically, and they often remain poorly validated statistically and/or experimentally. In this study, we evaluated the performance of known methods, and compared them with newly developed data processing strategies in terms of resolution, precision and robustness. RESULTS: Our results indicate that simple methods that do not rely on the estimation of the efficiency of the PCR amplification may provide reproducible and sensitive data, but that they do not quantify DNA with precision. Other evaluated methods based on sigmoidal or exponential curve fitting were generally of both poor resolution and precision. A statistical analysis of the parameters that influence efficiency indicated that it depends mostly on the selected amplicon and to a lesser extent on the particular biological sample analyzed. Thus, we devised various strategies based on individual or averaged efficiency values, which were used to assess the regulated expression of several genes in response to a growth factor. CONCLUSION: Overall, qPCR data analysis methods differ significantly in their performance, and this analysis identifies methods that provide DNA quantification estimates of high precision, robustness and reliability. These methods allow reliable estimations of relative expression ratio of two-fold or higher, and our analysis provides an estimation of the number of biological samples that have to be analyzed to achieve a given precision.},

abstract = {The problem of identifying differentially expressed genes in designed microarray experiments is considered. Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.},

abstract = {CD8 T cells play a key role in mediating protective immunity against selected pathogens after vaccination. Understanding the mechanism of this protection is dependent upon definition of the heterogeneity and complexity of cellular immune responses generated by different vaccines. Here, we identify previously unrecognized subsets of CD8 T cells based upon analysis of gene-expression patterns within single cells and show that they are differentially induced by different vaccines. Three prime-boost vector combinations encoding HIV Env stimulated antigen-specific CD8 T-cell populations of similar magnitude, phenotype, and functionality. Remarkably, however, analysis of single-cell gene-expression profiles enabled discrimination of a majority of central memory (CM) and effector memory (EM) CD8 T cells elicited by the three vaccines. Subsets of T cells could be defined based on their expression of Eomes, Cxcr3, and Ccr7, or Klrk1, Klrg1, and Ccr5 in CM and EM cells, respectively. Of CM cells elicited by DNA prime-recombinant adenoviral (rAd) boost vectors, 67{\%} were Eomes− Ccr7+ Cxcr3−, in contrast to only 7{\%} and 2{\%} stimulated by rAd5-rAd5 or rAd-LCMV, respectively. Of EM cells elicited by DNA-rAd, 74{\%} were Klrk1− Klrg1−Ccr5− compared with only 26{\%} and 20{\%} for rAd5-rAd5 or rAd5-LCMV. Definition by single-cell gene profiling of specific CM and EM CD8 T-cell subsets that are differentially induced by different gene-based vaccines will facilitate the design and evaluation of vaccines, as well as enable our understanding of mechanisms of protective immunity.},

abstract = {An incomplete understanding of the nature of heterogeneity within stem cell populations remains a major impediment to the development of clinically effective cell-based therapies. Transcriptional events within a single cell are inherently stochastic and can produce tremendous variability, even among genetically identical cells. It remains unclear how mammalian cellular systems overcome this intrinsic noisiness of gene expression to produce consequential variations in function, and what impact this has on the biologic and clinical relevance of highly ‘purified' cell subgroups. To address these questions, we have developed a novel method combining microfluidic-based single cell analysis and information theory to characterize and predict transcriptional programs across hundreds of individual cells. Using this technique, we demonstrate that multiple subpopulations exist within a well-studied and putatively homogeneous stem cell population, murine long-term hematopoietic stem cells (LT-HSCs). These subgroups are defined by nonrandom patterns that are distinguishable from noise and are consistent with known functional properties of these cells. We anticipate that this analytic framework can also be applied to other cell types to elucidate the relationship between transcriptional and phenotypic variation.},

More recently, specific cell functions and underlying regulatory networks of rare cells isolated from their natural environment moved to the center of attention. However, low cell numbers still hinder gene expression profiling of rare ex vivo material in biomedical research. Therefore, we developed a robust method for gene expression profiling of single cells on high-density oligonucleotide arrays with excellent coverage of low abundance transcripts. The protocol was extensively tested with freshly isolated single cells of very low mRNA content including single epithelial, mature and immature dendritic cells and hematopoietic stem cells. Quantitative PCR confirmed that the PCR-based global amplification method did not change the relative ratios of transcript abundance and unsupervised hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the histogenetic origin of an individual cell is correctly reflected by the gene expression profile. Moreover, the gene expression data from dendritic cells demonstrate that cellular differentiation and pathway activation can be monitored in individual cells.},

abstract = {To improve cancer therapy, it is critical to target metastasizing cells. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are rare cells found in the blood of patients with solid tumors and may play a key role in cancer dissemination. Uncovering CTC phenotypes offers a potential avenue to inform treatment. However, CTC transcriptional profiling is limited by leukocyte contamination; an approach to surmount this problem is single cell analysis. Here we demonstrate feasibility of performing high dimensional single CTC profiling, providing early insight into CTC heterogeneity and allowing comparisons to breast cancer cell lines widely used for drug discovery. We purified CTCs using the MagSweeper, an immunomagnetic enrichment device that isolates live tumor cells from unfractionated blood. CTCs that met stringent criteria for further analysis were obtained from 70{\%} (14/20) of primary and 70{\%} (21/30) of metastatic breast cancer patients; none were captured from patients with non-epithelial cancer (n = 20) or healthy subjects (n = 25). Microfluidic-based single cell transcriptional profiling of 87 cancer-associated and reference genes showed heterogeneity among individual CTCs, separating them into two major subgroups, based on 31 highly expressed genes. In contrast, single cells from seven breast cancer cell lines were tightly clustered together by sample ID and ER status. CTC profiles were distinct from those of cancer cell lines, questioning the suitability of such lines for drug discovery efforts for late stage cancer therapy. For the first time, we directly measured high dimensional gene expression in individual CTCs without the common practice of pooling such cells. Elevated transcript levels of genes associated with metastasis NPTN, S100A4, S100A9, and with epithelial mesenchymal transition: VIM, TGF{\ss}1, ZEB2, FOXC1, CXCR4, were striking compared to cell lines. Our findings demonstrate that profiling CTCs on a cell-by-cell basis is possible and may facilitate the application of ‘liquid biopsies' to better model drug discovery.},

Our goals were to estimate technical variance associated with Illumina sequencing in this context and to compare its ability to identify differentially expressed genes with existing array technologies. To do so, we estimated gene expression differences between liver and kidney RNA samples using multiple sequencing replicates, and compared the sequencing data to results obtained from Affymetrix arrays using the same RNA samples. We find that the Illumina sequencing data are highly replicable, with relatively little technical variation, and thus, for many purposes, it may suffice to sequence each mRNA sample only once (i.e., using one lane). The information in a single lane of Illumina sequencing data appears comparable to that in a single array in enabling identification of differentially expressed genes, while allowing for additional analyses such as detection of low-expressed genes, alternative splice variants, and novel transcripts. Based on our observations, we propose an empirical protocol and a statistical framework for the analysis of gene expression using ultra-high-throughput sequencing technology.},

                                    Gene-expression analysis is increasingly important in biological research, with real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) becoming the method of choice for high-throughput and accurate expression profiling of selected genes. Given the increased sensitivity, reproducibility and large dynamic range of this methodology, the requirements for a proper internal control gene for normalization have become increasingly stringent. Although housekeeping gene expression has been reported to vary considerably, no systematic survey has properly determined the errors related to the common practice of using only one control gene, nor presented an adequate way of working around this problem.
                                  
                                    Results
                                    We outline a robust and innovative strategy to identify the most stably expressed control genes in a given set of tissues, and to determine the minimum number of genes required to calculate a reliable normalization factor. We have evaluated ten housekeeping genes from different abundance and functional classes in various human tissues, and demonstrated that the conventional use of a single gene for normalization leads to relatively large errors in a significant proportion of samples tested. The geometric mean of multiple carefully selected housekeeping genes was validated as an accurate normalization factor by analyzing publicly available microarray data.

abstract = {Analysis of gene expression data using genome-wide microarrays is a technique often used in genomic studies to find coexpression patterns and locate groups of co-transcribed genes. However, most studies done at global “omic” scale are not focused on human samples and when they correspond to human very often include heterogeneous datasets, mixing normal with disease-altered samples. Moreover, the technical noise present in genome-wide expression microarrays is another well reported problem that many times is not addressed with robust statistical methods, and the estimation of errors in the data is not provided. Human genome-wide expression data from a controlled set of normal-healthy tissues is used to build a confident human gene coexpression network avoiding both pathological and technical noise. To achieve this we describe a new method that combines several statistical and computational strategies: robust normalization and expression signal calculation; correlation coefficients obtained by parametric and non-parametric methods; random cross-validations; and estimation of the statistical accuracy and coverage of the data. All these methods provide a series of coexpression datasets where the level of error is measured and can be tuned. To define the errors, the rates of true positives are calculated by assignment to biological pathways. The results provide a confident human gene coexpression network that includes 3327 gene-nodes and 15841 coexpression-links and a comparative analysis shows good improvement over previously published datasets. Further functional analysis of a subset core network, validated by two independent methods, shows coherent biological modules that share common transcription factors. The network reveals a map of coexpression clusters organized in well defined functional constellations. Two major regions in this network correspond to genes involved in nuclear and mitochondrial metabolism and investigations on their functional assignment indicate that more than 60{\%} are house-keeping and essential genes. The network displays new non-described gene associations and it allows the placement in a functional context of some unknown non-assigned genes based on their interactions with known gene families. The identification of stable and reliable human gene to gene coexpression networks is essential to unravel the interactions and functional correlations between human genes at an omic scale. This work contributes to this aim, and we are making available for the scientific community the validated human gene coexpression networks obtained, to allow further analyses on the network or on some specific gene associations.

abstract = {CD8+ T cells are a key component of the adaptive immune response to viral infection. An inadequate CD8+ T cell response is thought to be partly responsible for the persistent chronic infection that arises following infection with HIV. It is therefore critical to identify ways to define what constitutes an adequate or inadequate response. IFN-$\gamma$ production has been used as a measure of T cell function, but the relationship between cytokine production and the ability of a cell to lyse virus-infected cells is not clear. Moreover, the ability to assess multiple CD8+ T cell functions with single-cell resolution using freshly isolated blood samples, and subsequently to recover these cells for further functional analyses, has not been achieved. As described here, to address this need, we have developed a high-throughput, automated assay in 125-pl microwells to simultaneously evaluate the ability of thousands of individual CD8+ T cells from HIV-infected patients to mediate lysis and to produce cytokines. This concurrent, direct analysis enabled us to investigate the correlation between immediate cytotoxic activity and short-term cytokine secretion. The majority of in vivo primed, circulating HIV-specific CD8+ T cells were discordant for cytolysis and cytokine secretion, notably IFN-$\gamma$, when encountering cognate antigen presented on defined numbers of cells. Our approach should facilitate determination of signatures of functional variance among individual effector CD8+ T cells, including those from mucosal samples and those induced by vaccines.},

Our approach entails specifying marginal regression models for the outcomes, and combining them via a copula to form a joint model. Specifically, we propose marginal regression models (e.g. generalized linear models) to link the outcomes' marginal means to covariates. To account for associations between outcomes, we adopt the Gaussian copula to indirectly specify their joint distributions. Our approach has two advantages over current methods: one, regression parameters in models for both outcomes are marginally meaningful, and two, the association is 'margin-free', in the sense that it is characterized by the copula alone. By assuming a latent variable framework to describe discrete outcomes, the copula used still uniquely determines the joint distribution. In addition, association measures between outcomes can be interpreted in the usual way. We report results of simulations concerning the bias and efficiency of two likelihood-based estimation methods for the model. Finally, we illustrate the model using data on burn injuries.

abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

abstract = {Genome-wide transcriptome analyses are routinely used to monitor tissue-, disease- and cell type–specific gene expression, but it has been technically challenging to generate expression profiles from single cells. Here we describe a robust mRNA-Seq protocol (Smart-Seq) that is applicable down to single cell levels. Compared with existing methods, Smart-Seq has improved read coverage across transcripts, which enhances detailed analyses of alternative transcript isoforms and identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We determined the sensitivity and quantitative accuracy of Smart-Seq for single-cell transcriptomics by evaluating it on total RNA dilution series. We found that although gene expression estimates from single cells have increased noise, hundreds of differentially expressed genes could be identified using few cells per cell type. Applying Smart-Seq to circulating tumor cells from melanomas, we identified distinct gene expression patterns, including candidate biomarkers for melanoma circulating tumor cells. Our protocol will be useful for addressing fundamental biological problems requiring genome-wide transcriptome profiling in rare cells.},

abstract = {Motivation: Traditional gene expression analysis techniques capture an average gene expression state across sample replicates. However, the average signal across replicates will not capture activated gene networks in different states across replicates. For example, if a particular gene expression network is activated within a subset or all sample replicates, yet the activation state across the sample replicates differs by the specific genes activated in each replicate, the activation of this network will be washed out by averaging across replicates. This situation is likely to occur in single cell gene expression experiments or in noisy experimental settings where a small sub-population of cells contributes to the gene expression signature of interest.},

We implemented ABC model choice in a wide range of phylogenetic models in the Do It Yourself-ABC (DIY-ABC) software [Cornuet et al. (2008) Bioinformatics 24:2713–2719]. We now present arguments as to why the theoretical arguments for ABC model choice are missing, because the algorithm involves an unknown loss of information induced by the use of insufficient summary statistics. The approximation error of the posterior probabilities of the models under comparison may thus be unrelated with the computational effort spent in running an ABC algorithm. We then conclude that additional empirical verifications of the performances of the ABC procedure as those available in DIY-ABC are necessary to conduct model choice.},

abstract = {Variations on the transcriptome from one skeletal muscle type to another still remain unknown. The reliable identification of stable gene coexpression networks is essential to unravel gene functions and define biological processes. The differential expression of two distinct muscles, M. flexor digitorum (FD) and M. psoas major (PM), was studied using microarrays in cattle to illustrate muscle-specific transcription patterns and to quantify changes in connectivity regarding the expected gene coexpression pattern. A total of 206 genes were differentially expressed (DE), 94 upregulated in PM and 112 in FD. The distribution of DE genes in pathways and biological functions was explored in the context of system biology. Global interactomes for genes of interest were predicted. Fast/slow twitch genes, genes coding for extracellular matrix, ribosomal and heat shock proteins, and fatty acid uptake centred the specific gene expression patterns per muscle. Genes involved in repairing mechanisms, such as ribosomal and heat shock proteins, suggested a differential ability of muscles to react to similar stressing factors, acting preferentially in slow twitch muscles. Muscle attributes do not seem to be completely explained by the muscle fibre composition. Changes in connectivity accounted for 24{\%} of significant correlations between DE genes. Genes changing their connectivity mostly seem to contribute to the main differential attributes that characterize each specific muscle type. These results underscore the unique flexibility of skeletal muscle where a substantial set of genes are able to change their behavior depending on the circumstances.},

abstract = {DNA microarrays are a new and promising biotechnology whichallows the monitoring of expression levels in cells for thousands of genes simultaneously. The present paper describes statistical methods for the identi cation of di erentially expressed genes in replicated cDNA microarray experiments. Although it is not the main focus of the paper, new methods for the important pre-processing steps of image analysis and normalization are proposed. Given suitably normalized data, the biological question of di erential expression is restated as a problem in multiple hypothesis testing: the simultaneous test for each geneof the null hypothesis of no association between the expression levels and responses or covariates of interest. Di erentially expressed genes are identi ed based on adjusted p-values for a multiple testing procedure which strongly controls the family-wise Type I error rate and takes into account the dependence structure between the gene expression levels. No speci c parametric form is assumed for the distribution of the test statistics and a permutation procedure is used to estimate adjusted p-values. Several data displays are suggested for the visual identi cation of di erentially expressed genes and of important features of these genes. The above methods are applied to microarray data from a study of gene expression in the livers of mice with very low HDL cholesterol levels. The genes identi ed using data from multiple slides are compared to those identi ed by recently published single-slide methods.

Intrinsic versions of the Crame´r-Rao bound on manifolds utilizing an arbitrary affine connection with arbitrary geodesics are derived for both biased and unbiased estimators. In the example of covariance matrix estimation, closed-form expressions for both the intrinsic and flat bounds are derived and compared with the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the sample covariance matrix (SCM) estimator for varying sample support K. The accuracy bound on unbiased covariance matrix estimators is shown to be about (10/log 10)n/K},

To achieve this, however, appropriate normalisation strategies are required to control for experimental error introduced during the multistage process required to extract and process the RNA. There are many strategies that can be chosen; these include normalisation to sample size, total RNA and the popular practice of measuring an internal reference or housekeeping gene. However, these methods are frequently applied without appropriate validation.

We show that human colon cancer tissues contain distinct cell populations whose transcriptional identities mirror those of the different cellular lineages of normal colon. By creating monoclonal tumor xenografts from injection of a single (n = 1) cell, we demonstrate that the transcriptional diversity of cancer tissues is largely explained by in vivo multilineage differentiation and not only by clonal genetic heterogeneity. Finally, we show that the different gene-expression programs linked to multilineage differentiation are strongly associated with patient survival.

abstract = {Graphical models are well suited to capture the complex and non-Gaussian statistical dependencies that arise in many real-world signals. A fundamental problem common to any signal processing application of a graphical model is that of computing approximate marginal probabilities over subsets of nodes. This paper proposes a novel method, applicable to discrete-valued Markov random fields (MRFs) on arbitrary graphs, for approximately solving this marginalization problem . The foundation of our method is a reformulation of the marginalization problem as the solution of a low-dimensional convex optimization problem over the marginal polytope. Exactly solving this problem for general graphs is intractable; for binary Markov random fields, we describe how to relax it by using a Gaussian bound on the discrete entropy and a semidefinite outer bound on the marginal polytope. This combination leads to a log-determinant maximization problem that can be solved efficiently by interior point methods, thereby providing approximations to the exact marginals. We show how a slightly weakened log-determinant relaxation can be solved even more efficiently by a dual reformulation. When applied to denoising problems in a coupled mixture-of-Gaussian model defined on a binary MRF with cycles, we find that the performance of this log-determinant relaxation is comparable or superior to the widely used sum-product algorithm over a range of experimental conditions.},

The proposed method of inference can be viewed as a generalization of marginal likelihood estimation, in which inference for a parameter of interest is based on a summary statistic whose sampling distribution is not a function of any nuisance parameters. In the context of copula estimation, the extended rank likelihood is a function of the association parameters only and its applicability does not depend on any assumptions about the marginal distributions of the data, thus making it appropriate for the analysis of mixed continuous and discrete data with arbitrary marginal distributions. Estimation and inference for parameters of the Gaussian copula are available via a straightforward Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm based on Gibbs sampling. Specification of prior distributions or a parametric form for the univariate marginal distributions of the data is not necessary.},

abstract = {The formalism of probabilistic graphical models provides a unifying framework for capturing complex dependencies among random variables, and building large-scale multivariate statistical models. Graphical models have become a focus of research in many statistical, computational and mathematical fields, including bioinformatics, communication theory, statistical physics, combinatorial optimization, signal and image processing, information retrieval and statistical machine learning. Many problems that arise in specific instances — including the key problems of computing marginals and modes of probability distributions — are best studied in the general setting. Working with exponential family representations, and exploiting the conjugate duality between the cumulant function and the entropy for exponential families, we develop general variational representations of the problems of computing likelihoods, marginal probabilities and most probable configurations. We describe how a wide variety of algorithms — among them sum-product, cluster variational methods, expectation-propagation, mean field methods, max-product and linear programming relaxation, as well as conic programming relaxations — can all be understood in terms of exact or approximate forms of these variational representations. The variational approach provides a complementary alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo as a general source of approximation methods for inference in large-scale statistical models.},

abstract = {The mouse has become an indispensable and versatile model organism for the study of development, genetics, behavior, and disease. The application of comprehensive gene expression profiling technologies to compare normal and diseased tissues or to assess molecular alterations resulting from various experimental interventions has the potential to provide highly detailed qualitative and quantitative descriptions of these processes. Ideally, to interpret experimental data, the magnitude and diversity of gene expression for the system under study should be well characterized, yet little is known about the normal variation of mouse gene expression in vivo. To assess natural differences in murine gene expression, we used a 5406-clone spotted cDNA microarray to quantitate transcript levels in the kidney, liver, and testis from each of 6 normal male C57BL6 mice. We used ANOVA to compare the variance across the six mice to the variance among four replicate experiments performed for each mouse tissue. For the 6 kidney samples, 102 of 3,088 genes (3.3{\%}) exhibited a statistically significant mouse variance at a level of 0.05. In the testis, 62 of 3,252 genes (1.9{\%}) showed statistically significant variance, and in the liver, there were 21 of 2,514 (0.8{\%}) genes with significantly variable expression. Immune-modulated, stress-induced, and hormonally regulated genes were highly represented among the transcripts that were most variable. The expression levels of several genes varied significantly in more than one tissue. These studies help to define the baseline level of variability in mouse gene expression and emphasize the importance of replicate microarray experiments.},

abstract = {Recent methods for estimating sparse undirected graphs for real-valued data in high dimensional problems rely heavily on the assumption of normality. We show how to use a semiparametric Gaussian copula—or “nonparanormal”—for high dimensional inference. Just as additive models extend linear models by replacing linear functions with a set of one-dimensional smooth functions, the nonparanormal extends the normal by transforming the variables by smooth functions. We derive a method for estimating the nonparanormal, study the method's theoretical properties, and show that it works well in many examples.},
